Following an all-out battle with the Paranormal Liberation Front, it is difficult for the people of Japan to continue placing faith in their heroes. To combat the combined power of Tomura Shigaraki and All For One, All Might calls for his ally from the West—the strongest woman on the planet, Star and Stripe. However, All For One decides to intercept Star and her fleet to get his hands on her overpowered quirk before she can enter Japanese airspace. Although Endeavor, Hawks, and Best Jeanist are headed to the rendezvous point, Star makes a gamble in the present to save her comrades. (Source: MAL Rewrite) Note: The season was preceded by a 4-episode special titled 'Boku no Hero Academia: Memories' recapping events from the 6th season along with adding a few minutes of new material each episode.";s:5:"score";i:81;s:10:"popularity";i:121963;s:8:"synonyms";a:2:{i:0;s:6:"BNHA 7";i:1;s:5:"MHA 7";}s:10:"start_date";s:10:"2024-05-04";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"2024-10-12";s:9:"relations";a:0:{}}}s:7:"expires";i:1749094386;}
